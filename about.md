Hi I am Anirban Dutta, currently a grad student at Purdue University. I am deeply involved with the [PhoSim](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home/) group and work with Prof. [J.R.Peterson ](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/peterson.php). We also use WIYN 3.5m for Weak Lensing measurements. When I am not working, I like playing with interesting data and painting.

I have previously worked on making a Level 2 pipeline for UVIT on board ASTROSAT which was India's first space observatory. I worked at NCRA with Prof. [Swarna K Ghosh](https://www.tifr.res.in/~swarna/)

A part of our reasearch involves making cool images. Here are a few from WIYN

![Abell 2390]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/about_images/2390_standard.jpeg)
*Galaxy Cluster Abell 2390*


![Abell 2390 vs Hubble]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/about_images/2390_hubble_comparison.jpg)
*Hubble Image(Left) of Abell 2390 vs our Image.Of course Hubble wins, as one of my colleague said, but or image has a much larger field(not shown here)*


![Abell 115]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/about_images/115_cluster_superZoom1.jpeg)
*Galaxy Cluster Abell 115*


![NGC 2336]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/header_img.png)
*Galaxy NGC 2336 using UVIT. This was UVIT's one of the very first image used for performace verification. Some familiar readers might remember it was dataset 1191*
