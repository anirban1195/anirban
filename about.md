Hi I am Anirban Dutta, currently a grad student at Purdue University. I am deepy involved with the [PhoSim](https://bitbucket.org/phosim/phosim_release/wiki/Home/) group. We also use WIYN 3.5m for Weak Lensing measurements. When I am not working, I like playing with interesting data and painting.
I have previously worked on making a Level 2 pipeline for UVIT on board ASTROSAT which was India's frst space observatory.
