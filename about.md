I am a recent PhD graduate from Purdue University. My research focuses on galaxy clusters, large-scale structures, and their study using multi-wavelength analysis. More recently, I have begun applying machine learning (ML) methods to these topics. 

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy playing with interesting data, painting, and tennis.

A part of our research involves making cool images. Here are a few from the WIYN telescope and the UVIT instrument:


![Abell 2390]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/about_images/a2390_center.png)
*The galaxy cluster Abell 2390. This deep image from WIYN reaches a limiting magnitude of r ~ 27.*

![Abell 2390_wide]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/about_images/a2390_wide.png)
*The wide filed containing Abell 2390*

![NGC 2336]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/header_img.png)
*The galaxy NGC 2336, viewed by the UVIT instrument. This was one of the very first images used for its performance verification. (Familiar readers might remember it as dataset 1191!)*
